Description: Amazon S3 compatible server
 LibreS3 is a robust Open Source replacement for the Amazon S3 service,
 implementing (a subset of) the S3 REST API.
 .
 Standard S3 client libraries and tools (for example s3cmd, python-boto, ...)
 can be used to access it.
 .
 It uses Skylable SX as the storage backend, which automatically provides
 data deduplication and replication.

Description: Scalable public and private cloud storage
 Skylable Sx is a reliable, fully distributed cluster solution for your data
 storage needs.
 .
 With Sx you can aggregate the disk space available on multiple servers and
 merge it into a single storage system.
 The cluster makes sure that your data is always replicated over multiple nodes
 (the exact number of copies is defined by the sysadmin) and synchronized.
 .
 Additionally Sx has built-in support for deduplication, client-side
 encryption, on-the-fly compression and much more.
